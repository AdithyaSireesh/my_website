    "bio":"As you can see from the background pic, I love playing tennis. I am also fond of playing chess, and just about any classic strategy based game. I am a mathematics enthusiast. During my free time, I like to apply my mind in trying to come up with methods to solve various unsolved math problems. This habit not only helps me stimulate my brain, but also it teaches me to not stick to a single approach and come up with various perspectives while tackling any problems in life.",
